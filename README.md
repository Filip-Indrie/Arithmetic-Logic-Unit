# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) – Digital Design Project

This repository contains the design and implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) developed as a team project for the Computer Networks (CN) laboratory at the Polytechnic University of Timișoara (2025).

The ALU was designed from the ground up and supports the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project covers all major development stages, including hardware architecture design, modular implementation, and functional testing.

The implementation emphasizes low-level digital design concepts, with custom-built components such as registers, counters, adders, and a control unit, integrated into a complete ALU module.

For a detailed explanation of the architecture, design decisions, implementation, and test results, please refer to `ALU documentation.pdf`.
